-   npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rama4zis/rock-paper-scissors.git
    cd rock-paper-scissors
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Express and Socket.IO.

    ```
    (If you have a `package.json` file, you can simply run `npm install`)

### Running the Application

    ```
    For development, you might prefer using `nodemon` for automatic server restarts on file changes:

    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üéÆ How to Play

1.  **Enter Details:**
    *   Open the game in two separate browser tabs or on two different devices.
    *   On the main page, each player should enter a **Username** and a common **Room ID**.
    *   If the Room ID doesn't exist, a new room will be created.
    *   If the Room ID exists and has fewer than two players, the player will join it.
    *   Rooms are limited to a maximum of two players. If a third player tries to join, they will be notified that the room is full.

2.  **Wait for Opponent:**
    *   If you're the first in the room, wait for another player to join using the same Room ID.
    *   Players will receive a notification when another player joins the room.

3.  **Make Your Choice:**
    *   Once two players are in the room, the game can begin!
    *   Each player secretly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    *   Players will be notified when their opponent has made a choice (but not what they chose!).

4.  **See the Result:**
    *   After both players have made their choices, the game server determines the winner.
    *   The result (e.g., "Player 1 Wins!", "It's a Draw!") will be displayed to both players in a modal.

5.  **Chat with Your Opponent:**
    *   Use the chatbox to send messages to your opponent during the game.
    *   A typing indicator will show when the other player is typing.

6.  **Play Again:**
    *   After the result is shown, player choices are reset, and you can play another round in the same room.
